# Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning for Joint Decoupled User Association and Trajectory Design in Full-Duplex Multi-UAV Networks
The simulations are performed with Python 3.6 and PyTorch 1.7 under the PyCharm platform.
A full-duplex multi-UAV network is considered.
Four association modes are compared for performance evaluation.
For verify the performance of the MADRL approach training with the clip-and-count based PPO, Vanilla PG,Trust region policy optimization (TRPO), and the original PPO are considered for comparison purpose.
Implemented with various settings.
